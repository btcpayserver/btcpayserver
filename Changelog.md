## 1.6.0

In the past six months, we fixed a critical security vulnerability in one of BTCPay's versions. The security vulnerability has been disclosed responsibly, and we granted a bounty to the security researcher who discovered it. As far as we know, this particular vulnerability has not been exploited in the wild as it depends on multiple factors. For security reasons, we will not publicly disclose details yet. Timeframe for public disclosure is 6-12 months. We already have a CVE number reserved for it.

It's very likely that by updating BTCPay Server in the past six months, you've already patched this vulnerability. To be safe, update your instance if you haven't done so in a long time.

## 1.4.0

BTCPay Server started in August 2017 and meanwhile has been evolving incrementally thanks to the feedback of the community.

It was finally time to cleanup the UI/UX and technical debt we accumulated over the years.

We enumerate here a lot of new features and bug fixes, but we do not enumerate the UI/UX changes, we dedicated a separate [blog post for this topic](https://blog.btcpayserver.org/btcpay-server-1-4-0/).

The heavy lifting of this work has been mainly brought to you thanks to the collaboration of @dstrukt and @dennisreimann.
We thank also all the testers we brought us feedback, and all of you who participated in the weekly design meetings.

The work on the UI/UX is however never over and we will keep on improving it based on your feedback.

Note: If you are using our docker deployment on a raspberry pi 4, there is a small chance your docker version does not support the new docker image.
If you have any issue with raspberry pi 4, you need to update your docker version following steps on [this blog post](https://blog.samcater.com/fix-workaround-rpi4-docker-libseccomp2-docker-20/).
Note that you do not need to update libseccomp2, our update process does this for you automatically.
